# Talk about Arduino and microcontroller

This Repo contains the presentation and code files of the Arduino Talk (Workgroup internal). 

By no means is this a comprehensive guide or claims to complete or free of errors.
This is just to provide the audience with all materials used in the talk.

For better guidance to get startet I highly recommend the following recources:

* [Tutorials at arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage)
* [Installing Arduino on Windows from adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/lesson-0-getting-started/installing-arduino-windows)
* [Installing Arduino on Mac and Linux from adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/lesson-0-getting-started/installing-arduino-mac-and-linux)
